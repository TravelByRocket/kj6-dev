## Interior Design Insights & Environment Improvements

*Compiled insights from personal notes for interior design consultation*

### Current Living Situation & Priority Areas

#### Bedroom
**Current Challenge**: Plant shelves are "ugly and inefficient"  
**Vision**: Replace with space-efficient design maximizing sunlight and visual appeal  
**Plant Collection**: ~30 plants total (3 bathroom, ~10 kitchen counter + hanging, rest at bedroom window)  
**Additional Issues**: 

- Workbench area has storage overflow and clutter
- Variable sun/light intensity at window desk location
- Need deeper desk for laptop riser + keyboard setup

#### Living Areas & Flow
**Current Setup Issues**:

- **Couch laptop setup**: Need better solution for relaxed computing/eating without awkward leaning toward TV stand
- **Counter laptop setup**: Currently decent with riser but doesn't face outside/TV for breakfast comfort
- **Morning routine optimization needed**: Design space for cereal, coffee, couch time for TV and/or personal computer work

**Goals**:
- Improve furniture arrangement for better flow
- Both functional and ambient lighting improvements  
- Color/texture coordination that works with plant collection
- Use plants as focal design elements throughout space

#### Kitchen/Nutrition Space
**Challenge**: Create comfortable breakfast eating area that faces outside or TV for morning routine  
**Current State**: ~10 plants on kitchen counter plus hanging plants need better organization for improved flow

### Design Aesthetics & Style Preferences

### Functional Requirements

#### Workspace Optimization
**Deep Work Environment Needs** (influenced by Cal Newport's "Eudaimonia Machine"):
1. **Gallery** - Examples of work/achievements for motivation
2. **Salon** - Coffee, comfortable seating for thinking/brooding  
3. **Library** - Resource storage and reference materials
4. **Office Space** - Desk area for focused work
5. **Deep Work Chamber** - Distraction-free space for intense focus

#### Storage Solutions
**Current State**: "Decently organized" but needs improvement  
**Goals**: 

- Advanced organizational systems
- Design-integrated storage that enhances rather than detracts from aesthetics
- Plant care supply organization

### Workflow & Routine Support

#### Morning Routine Flow
**Ideal Sequence**: Breakfast → coffee → meditate → write → plan → clear email  
**Space Requirements**: Comfortable area for eating while facing outside/TV

#### Energy & Mode Management
**Living Patterns**: Natural cycles between Build Mode (deep development), Social Mode (connection), and Explore Mode (learning/creativity)  
**Space Needs**: Environment should support transitions between these modes

#### Clean Environment Prerequisite
**Foundation Requirement**: "Clean and organized apartment prerequisite" for entering productive modes  
**Philosophy**: Organized environment supports all other life areas and routines

### Plant Integration Strategy

#### Current Collection
- **Total**: ~30 plants
- **Bathroom**: 3 plants  
- **Kitchen**: ~10 plants (counter + hanging)
- **Bedroom Window**: Majority of collection

#### Design Integration Goals
- Leverage existing plant collection as primary design feature
- Maximize sunlight access and visual appeal
- Efficient space utilization
- Easy maintenance access
