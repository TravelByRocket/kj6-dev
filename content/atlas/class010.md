## Personal Introductions & Syllabus

### Instructor

I began my journey in Aerospace Engineering, which gave me a foundation of problem-solving and technical skills. I‚Äôve ventured into several different industries since then, each adding to my experience and perspective. Although I‚Äôm a self-taught developer, my design and engineering background has been greatly shaped my approach to software development.

I continue to work on developing my own apps‚Äîa process that, while sometimes slow, is fascinating and rewarding. Every step of the way, I‚Äôm constantly learning and applying new ideas, which I‚Äôm excited to share with you in this course.

	* Generative Art
	* Unity 3D (turns out to be like aerospace)
	* iOS App for Haunted House

## Introduction Apple, Xcode, Swift, SwiftUI

Apple is the creator of Xcode, the essential tool for developing apps across all Apple platforms. Swift, an open-source programming language initially developed by Apple, has become the standard for building modern apps. SwiftUI, a closed-source UI framework also developed by Apple, is the future of app development, gradually replacing the older UIKit framework. Be thankful that you‚Äôre entering this space now that it is a much more approachable space to be in than just a few years ago!

Swift and SwiftUI have evolved rapidly, but we‚Äôre reaching a point where things are starting to stabilize‚Äîespecially with Swift. The language continues to introduce new features, but the pace of change is slowing down. We‚Äôre currently in a transition from Swift 5 to Swift 6, with strict concurrency being the most significant update. This change is likely to be the last major shift for a while, but it will also break a lot of existing code. As a result, some projects may remain in Swift 5 mode until the heat death of the universe.

While some developers argue that SwiftUI isn‚Äôt fully ready for widespread adoption, I strongly disagree‚Äîwith almost no exceptions. Yes, there are still a few things that UIKit can do that SwiftUI can‚Äôt, but that gap is closing fast. Eventually (perhaps a decade from now), UIKit may no longer be the preferred tool for anything. The complaints about SwiftUI often come from developers who learned the ‚Äúold way‚Äù and haven‚Äôt fully embraced the SwiftUI mindset. Other frustrations arise from trying to force SwiftUI to do things it wasn‚Äôt designed for, rather than following the natural, native patterns.

Personally, I know very little about UIKit, and Objective-C still looks completely foreign to me. From my perspective, anyone complaining about SwiftUI is either not fully understanding it, trying to do things the hard way, or both.

In short: Embrace SwiftUI. It‚Äôs the future, and with the right approach, it‚Äôs an incredibly powerful tool for building modern apps.

### Xcode

* New Project
	* The famous `Shift-Cmd-N`
		* A new file is merely `Cmd-N` üòÖ
	* Or from the menu
	* Select iOS App
	* Bundle Identifier as reverse URL
* Main files and structure
	* App
	* ContentView
	* Project File
* Navigator
	* Does not necessarily match file structure, but usually does
* Preview
	* Can be turned on and off
	* Error messages almost helpful (beware!)
	* Preview macro
* Simulator
	* Differences from physical device
	* No VoiceOver but can get close
	* Not 100% necessary for iOS dev
	* Select the OS (also affects Preview)
* Console Output
	* `print` of course
	* Common to get lots of useless messages
		* Worry more about IDE warnings and errors
* Settings
	* Accounts
	* Locations
	* Derived Data
* Help Menu
	* Documentation
	* Human Interface Guidelines
* Component Library
	* Configure views from side menu
* Show some main views
	* Text
	* Image
	* Button
	* padding
	* background
	* overlay
	* foreground style
	* shapes
* Settings
	* Login
	* Text Editing
		* Trim trailing whitespace
		* Including white-space only lines
		* Re-indent on paste
	* Derived Data
* Shortcuts
	* Ctrl-I to indent
