## Welcome!

Welcome to the world of mobile app development! In this course, you’ll take your first steps in creating mobile applications and learn the essential practices of being a mobile app developer. Here at the ATLAS Institute, you’re already building the design skills that, when combined with software development, can set you apart as an outstanding developer.

As you dive into this creative field, you’ll discover a wide variety of exciting directions to explore. The possibilities are endless, allowing you to design and build around your own ideas and opinions, from aesthetics to interactions. The unified and scalable ecosystem of mobile platforms means that your work can have a global reach, potentially transforming lives while fitting into the palm of someone’s hand. The ubiquity of mobile devices also opens up a wealth of business opportunities and more.

For me, the most rewarding part of this journey is the ability to “touch” my software—integrating hardware and software to create seamless human-computer interactions. It’s about molding technology to solve real problems and express my unique perspectives. 

In this course, we’ll focus on developing for iOS using SwiftUI. While we’ll be working exclusively with Apple’s tools, the skills you acquire here—especially in declarative UI—will serve you well if you decide to explore Android or React in the future.
