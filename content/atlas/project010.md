## Checkpoint 1 Feedback

* Each page needs to be in its own file so each one has its own preview
* Create projects with NO testing and NO storage
* CamelCaseNameApp no punctuation or spaces, same with views
* Every page and view should be descriptively named
* Show how to add files without making references that won't commit. Before submitting, try moving your project folder and see if it still works
* I want to see a commit history
* We need to use gitignore
* Show how to Nuke the project and bring over files
* We need to do some refactoring where we reuse our code
* If your content doesn't fit, use a ScrollView, please
* Future comments will come in a commit on a branch in the project
* Do not use ZIP file. Need to show proper structure.
* Use padding or spacing instead of `\n` or `""`
* Think about usability. When someone get to the end of your app, what about all those stacked views?
* Best ot make each modifier on a new line; and spaces between views
* Visual design wasn't part of the requirements but many phone it in on this
* Organize with App file first and ContentView second
* Let's clean up blatant UI issues
* for check 2 the app should run in simulator
* Make each page end with "Page"
* Let's make some reusable views with name ending "View"
* 750 words requirement
* Do not leave commented code in most cases
