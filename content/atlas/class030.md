### ZStack

* Will the the size of its largest view
* First view in the stack is at the bottom and successive views go over
* Nine typical alignments but even more exists https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/alignment

### ScrollView

* Beware adding padding to ScrollView itself, will cause scroll indicator to be strangely inset
* ScrollView will only be the width of its widest child view unless you expand it
* See in the API that you can hide the scroll indicators
* Try making a large HStack and place it in a ScrollView that scrolls horizontally

### List and Form

* https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/list
* Try out `listStyle`

## Interactive Views

### Toggle

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/toggle

### Button

We've used this a bit in examples already. Make your own that changes a property of your view. Use the `@State` property wrapper for the thing you are going to change. There are a few built-in button styles to try too. The action can use trailing closure syntax.
