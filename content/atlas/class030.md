Polish Notes

* Need to record a clear workflow for signing into GH with Xcode, creating a repo from assignment, cloning with Xcode, committing, pushing
* Wanted to show how to refactor repetitive code
* Record a video for Button, Toggle, State, Binding
* Ensure that I have clarified how to cite/note use of AI and all significant sources of code
